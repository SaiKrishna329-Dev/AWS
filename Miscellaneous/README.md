AWS Cloud Formation Templates:

  Think of it as "Infrastructure as Code (IaC)" â€” instead of manually clicking through the AWS console to set up your resources (like EC2, S3, RDS, etc.), you write a template that defines everything you want, and 
  CloudFormation sets it up for you.

 Example: template for EC2 Instance -- we can follow the documentation for creating templates, Yaml or Json format can be used.
